Creating Elements
-----------------

This just creates a new element object - same as //document.createElement//, but it also applies the MooTools extensions to that element.

#### JS

	var img = new Element("img");

//new Element// also lets you set any properties when you create it:

#### JS

	new Element('a', {
		styles: {
			'display': 'block',
			'border': '1px solid black'
		},
		events: {
			click: function(){
				//something to do on click
			},
			mousedown: function(){
				//something to do on mousedown
			}
		},
		/*	class must be in quotes; it is a reserved word in IE	*/
		'class': 'myClassSuperClass',
		href: 'http://mootools.net'
	});

The key 'styles' will be used as //setStyles//, the key 'events' will be used as //addEvents//. Any other key is used a property with //set//. Note that you don't have to write the keys with quotes ('styles' or 'events' - these can just be {styles: '...', events: '...'} - but **class** DOES have to be in quotes as it's a reserved word in IE.

**Note** that this doesn't insert the element into the DOM, you need to use //Element.adopt, .inject, .wraps,// etc. to put the element into the document:

#### JS

	new Element('img', {src: 'http//...'}).inject($(myElement));
