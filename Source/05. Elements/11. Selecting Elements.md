Selecting Elements
------------------

Here is [the documentation for Element](http://mootools.net/docs/core/Element/Element).

The Element object gets a LOT of love in MooTools. Most of the functions in the Element object are pretty self explanatory. *Element.get('tag')* does what you'd think it would.

===== $() =====
<html><p id="getElementByIdExample">
The $ function has 2 purposes: getting an element by its id, and applying all the elements methods to that element.
$ can take 2 types of arguments: a string representing the id of an element in the dom, or an element reference:
</p></html>

<code javascript exec>
//by a string representing the id of an element:
var element1 = $('getElementByIdExample');

//by element reference:
var element2 = $(element1.childNodes[0]);
</code>

now both element1 and element2 will have the mootools elements extensions applied.

Final Note:

In firefox and other modern browsers such as Safari and Opera, the elements extensions are automatically applied to all the elements in the dom. For the more unfortunate and crippled browsers like Internet Explorer, running the //$// function is mandatory to have the extensions applied.

===== $$() =====

The //$$// (double dollar) function has one big important role in MooTools: transforming a bunch of elements in an instance of the //Elements// class.

//$$// can take **any number** of different types of arguments:

  * element references
  * arrays of elements ids
  * native html collections (such as //document.getElementByTagName//, or //element.childNodes//)

**Note:** If you included [[mootorial:05-utilities:00-selectors|Selectors.js]], //$$// can also target elements using a CSS selector.

<code javascript>
 //all the pre and p tag elements on this page.
$$('pre', 'p');

//all the pres contained in the element with id=myElement
var myElement = $('myElement');
$$(myElement.getElementsByTagName('pre'));

//here we pass in several collections (all either Arrays
//or instances of Elements)
var myElements = $$(myElement.childNodes, myElement, ['anotherElementId']);
</code>

**Note:** the collection returned will be first all the elements matching the first argument, in order, then all the elements that match the second, in order, and so on. If you have alternating pre and p tags, the above example will still return all the pre tags, then all the p tags.

> ### Why $ and $$?
>
> MooTools aims to be as close to native JavaScript as possible.
>
> In native JavaScript, you have two main methods for element selection: document.getElementById() and document.querySelectorAll(). $ represents the former; $$ the latter.

===== Elements =====
The //Elements// class is really just an array of elements, but it's been extended to allow you to execute any of the extensions that you could execute on an element. So, for example:

<code javascript exec>
/* turn all the paragraphs on this page red */
$$('p').setStyle('color','red');
/* ok, that's ugly, let's turn it back */
(function(){$$('p').setStyle('color','#000')}).delay(1000);
</code>

The same is true for every method listed down below. The //Elements// class can be extended like the //Element// class and every //Elements// object will get the properties. There's a catch though.

**THIS IS IMPORTANT**

When you execute a method on a collection of elements, it will iterate through all the elements and execute that method on each. This is fine when you only need to execute one method, but **if you need to execute more than one method, you should loop through the elements**. Multiple method calls on an //Elements// object will loop through them all each time, and this will be very slow.

So, **this is bad**:

<code javascript>
$$('p').setStyle('color','red');
$$('p').effect('opacity').start(0,1);
//This is the same thing (and also bad):
$$('p').setStyle('color','red').effect('opacity').start(0,1);
</code>

In this example, it's far better to use a loop:

<code javascript>
$$('p').each(function(p){
  p.setStyle('color','red').effect('opacity').start(0,1);
});
</code>

//$$()// returns an instance of the //Elements// class, which is also an array, so it inherits all the methods in the //[[00-array|Array]]// object.

===== Element.getElements, .getElement =====
//Element.getElements// gets all the decendents of an element (so, not just the immediate children). You can pass in a selector to filter the group.

<code javascript exec>$('leftCol').getElements('p');</code>

The filter can be any css expression when you include //Selectors.js//, just like //$$//.

//Element.getElement// just returns the first item found.

===== Element.hasChild =====

<code javascript><div id="myElement">
	<div id="childOne"></div>
	<div id="childTwo"></div>
	<div id="childThree"></div>
</div>
<script>$('myElement').hasChild('childOne');//true</script>
</code>
