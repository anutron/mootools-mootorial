====== Suggested Reading ======
  * Obviously, I recommend reading my book - **__MooTools Essentials__** ([[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430209836?ie=UTF8&tag=clientside-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=1430209836|paperback]] or [[http://www.apress.com/book/view/1430209836|PDF]]). This is similar to the [[http://www.mootorial.com|MooTorial]] but much, much more complete.
   * I highly, highly, highly recommend reading **__[[http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742?tag=clientside-20|JavaScript: The Good Parts]]__** by **Douglas Crockford** (it came out about a month ago). There are some really awesome aspects to the language that make up for its deficiencies. Crockfordâ€™s book basically outlines the part of the language that are worth keeping.
  * I also recommend **[[http://www.snook.ca|Jonathan Snook]]**'s **__[[http://www.amazon.com/Accelerated-Scripting-Ajax-APIs-Libraries/dp/1590597648?tag=clientside-20|Accelerated DOM Scripting with Ajax, APIs, and Libraries]]__**.
