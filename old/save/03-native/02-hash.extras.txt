====== Hash.Extras ======
[[http://www.clientcide.com/docs/Native/Hash.Extras|docs]]

The [[http://www.mootorial.com/wiki/mootorial/03-native/04-hash|MooTools Hash]] is pretty powerful and complete and for the most part we wouldn't have much to add to it. We do however have two methods that we use occassionally.

===== getFromPath =====
This method returns a value from an object given a path to it (a string). Example:

<code javascript exec>$H({
    food: {
        fruits: {
            apples: "red",
            lemon: "yellow"
        }
    }
}).getFromPath("food.fruits.apples");
//returns "red"</code>


===== cleanValues ======

This method just removes any keys from the hash whose values are //undefined// or //null//. You can actually define your own logic by passing in your own method. By default, it uses //[[http://www.mootorial.com/wiki/mootorial/01-core#defined|$defined]]//. 

<code javascript exec>
var myHash = $H({
	foo: 'bar',
	something: 'else',
	missing: null
});
myHash.cleanValues();
console.log(myHash.getKeys());
</code>

Here I define what to clean as any integer value that is negative:

<code javascript exec>
var myHash = $H({
	a: -1,
	b: 2,
	c: 0,
	d: -5
});
myHash.cleanValues(function(value){
	if ($type(value) != "number") return true;
	return value >= 0;
});
console.log(myHash.getKeys());
</code>

===== run =====

This method will execute any value in the hash that is a function. Any arguments passed to //run// will be passed to each method in the hash. I use this to hold all my page initialization methods. For example:

<code javascript>
var MySite = {
	init: new Hash({
		setupSearch: function(){
			//set stuff up
		},
		setupMenu: function(){
			//set up menu stuff
		},
		pingGoogleAnalytics: function(){
			//ping google
		},
		etc...
	})
};

window.addEvent('domready', MySite.init.run.bind(MySite.init));
//same as
window.addEvent('domready', function(){
	MySite.init.run();
});
</code>

This way my startup code can grow without me having to go manage both a list of functions and a startup method that calls them all. I just add a new member to the hash and it automatically gets included win the whole has is run.
