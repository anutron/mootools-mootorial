====== Browser Extensions ======
MooTools includes a [[http://www.mootorial.com/wiki/mootorial/01-core/01-browser|Browser Hash]] object that includes information about the client. MooTools also, throughout the library, has code to eliminate browser inconsistencies for you.

Unfortunately, there are a few still out there, and when we run into one and come up with a solution (or, more likely, fine one on the net somewhere) we add it to our library.
