MooTools is flush with tons of extensions to the native javascript objects ([[http://www.mootorial.com/wiki/mootorial/03-native/00-array|Array]], [[http://www.mootorial.com/wiki/mootorial/03-native/01-function|Function]], [[http://www.mootorial.com/wiki/mootorial/03-native/02-number|Number]], [[http://www.mootorial.com/wiki/mootorial/03-native/03-string|String]], [[http://www.mootorial.com/wiki/mootorial/03-native/04-hash|Hash]], [[http://www.mootorial.com/wiki/mootorial/03-native/05-event|Event]]).
