====== Fupdate ======

[[http://www.clientcide.com/docs/Forms/Fupdate|docs]]

This class just automates the basic pattern of having a form that, when submitted, should send its data to the server via Ajax and take whatever comes back and inject it into a DOM element.

<html>
<form action="/wiki/simple.html.php" id="fupdateForm">
	<input type="text" name="message" title="enter some text here" class="OverTxt">
	<input type="submit">
</form>
<ul id="fupdateReply">
	<li>I'm a list item that will be replaced when you submit the form above</li>
</ul>
<script>
	window.addEvent('domready', function(){
		new OverText($$('input.OverTxt'));
	});
</script>
</html>

<code javascript exec>
new Fupdate(document.id('fupdateForm'), document.id('fupdateReply'));
</code>

That's pretty much all you gotta do.

===== About the name =====

I know - "Fupdate" (Form Update abbr.) is kinda lame, but I really couldn't come up with a better name... BTW, it's pronounced as one word (not "F-Update"; rather "fupdate"). I'm open to suggestions!
